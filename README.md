# FIVS_SECOND_RULE

This digital version of Five Second Rule was the last project I was involved on, I've worked in multiple fronts of it's development.
You can find the scripts that I was directly involved in : Five-Second-Rule/FIVE_SECOND_RULE/Assets/Scripts/
If you want to test the project, you can download this repo and add it as a project to Unity HUB, the Unity version used for it was 2021.2.9f1.
